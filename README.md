# card-compitition
1. ok to start off you need to download pillow in your terminal
2. use the command "pip install pillow"
3. now add the file of this code in a folder.
4. now add all the images of the cards participating in the compitition in this folder.
5. now run the code.
6. the code will randomly assign all the images in pairs of 2 (present in the same folder as the code)
7. and horizontally combine the images
8. incase if there are odd number off images 
9. it will randomly ignore 1 image and mention the image name which it ignored in the terminal
note:- it does not make any background so the surroundings are transparent you are free to mess around and make your own custom background.
as a output it will create a file (inside the same file you placed the code in) and have all the output images inside this file.

# card-compitition
ok to start off you need to download pillow in your terminal
use the command "pip install pillow"
now add the file of this code in a folder.
now add all the images of the cards participating in the compitition in this folder.
now run the code.
the code will randomly assign all the images in pairs of 2 (present in the same folder as the code)
and horizontally combine the images
incase if there are odd number off images 
it will randomly ignore 1 image and mention the image name which it ignored in the terminal
note:- it does not make any background so the surroundings are transparent you are free to mess around and make your own custom background.
as a output it will create a file (inside the same file you placed the code in) and have all the output images inside this file.
